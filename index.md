# What is this site?

This site is my personal page/online portfolio. A place where I can share some of my works, whether programming or art related, and a little about my self. The links at the top will direct you to different works I've done in my areas of interest.

# Who I am

I am a programmer and artist based out of the Coachella Valley, a region in Southern California. I have a formal education in Computer Science (BS). However, of the many things this field encompasses, web development is naturally the most appealing. I have yet to work a professional position in web development but I do spend quit a bit of time working on small projects (like this site) to keep my skills up. As of recent, I have been reading about JAM stack sites. Building this site was my introduction and it seems appealing as opposed to using WordPress, for smaller sites of course. In regards to art, I've been a traditional artist most of my life. The mediums I use the most are ink, pencil, and acrylic. I am also an experienced penman and have been into lettering since a young age. I'd like to put up pictures of these works sometime soon but I have to think of a layout that will fit good with how inconsistent the photos are. I've put up my Illustrator work however, something which I've been spending a lot of time with lately. I enjoy coming up with fictitious logos and such. If you're interested in not having my logos be fictitious, or you want to give me a job (I hope), please keep reading.

# Contact/Work

I am currently looking for a full time position. I am also available for freelance web/logo work. Use the link below to send me a message and we'll be on our way!
