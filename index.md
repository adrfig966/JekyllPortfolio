# What is this site?

This site is my personal page/online portfolio. A place where I can share some of my works, whether programming or art related, and a little about my self. The links at the top will direct you to different works I've done in my areas of interest.

# Who I am

I am a programmer and artist based out of the Coachella Valley, an area of Southern California. I have experience in general purpose languages, such as C++ and Python. However, my focus resides mainly in web development. The **Code** page has some examples of projects I've made. I've mainly worked using React as a front-end and NodeJS as a server. 

Besides programming, I also enjoy making traditional art and doing graphic design using Adobe Illustrator. You can find some examples of my work on the page labeled **Illustrator**. I will likely make a separate site for traditional art in the future.
# Contact/Work
