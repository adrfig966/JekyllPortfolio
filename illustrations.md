Below is a collection of various works I've done using Adobe Illustrator. I'm mainly interested in creating stuff for web, icons, logos, and typography. I've included small descriptions about where the idea came from and if there's any changes to be made.

    <p>A current work in progress. One of my favorite cars, the BMW E30 M3. Currently working on the wheels and front bumper details.</p>

    <p>My favorite, the banner to this site. Inspired by the mountains and windfarms on the outskirts of where I live, the Coachella Valley.</p>

    <p>My second idea was inspired by the nice drives you can take on empty stretches of road. This one might change however as I feel it's too empty and some of the colors aren't where I want them.</p>

    <p>This one I did for the sake of learning something. I wanted to figure out how to get the horns to have a natural looking spiral without manually making several small paths.</p>
