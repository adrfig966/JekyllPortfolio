Below is a collection of various works I've done using Adobe Illustrator. I'm mainly interested in creating stuff for web, icons, logos, and typography. I've included small descriptions about where the idea came from and if there's any changes to be made.

    <p>A current work in progress. One of my favorite cars, the BMW E30 M3. Currently working on the wheels and front bumper details.</p>

    <p>My favorite, the banner to this site. Inspired by the mountains and windfarms on the outskirts of where I live, the Coachella Valley.</p>

    <p>First of a series I'm doing relating to deserts. Naturally, my first idea was cacti.</p>

    <p>This one I did for the sake of learning a technique. I wanted the spiral details on the horns to be generated by Illustrator filling in details, rather than created manually by me making each one individually.</p>
