<ul>
    <li>Coin Gecko API was used for data.</li>
    <li>ChartJS was used for charts.</li>
    <li>From-scratch suggestions box.</li>
    <li>Uses Parcel to bundle assets and allow usage of PostCSS.</li>
</ul>

I mainly made this because I wanted to figure out how to have a chart on mobile and make it manageable with a big dataset. I ended up prototyping something on CodePen involving the canvas used by the charting library, some container divs, and some JQuery. While I'm not into crypto, it was an easy choice for relevant and free to use data. I chose Coin Gecko as it didn't require authorization and I didn't want to make a proxy server to secure my API keys for a simple project like this.
